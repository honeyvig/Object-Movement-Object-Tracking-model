# Object-Movement-Object-Tracking-model
To create a Python solution using TensorFlow and computer vision for tracking pickleball players, balls, and paddles in real-time, we can break it down into key components: object detection, object tracking, and possibly pose estimation. The solution will require the use of a deep learning model for object detection, and computer vision techniques for real-time tracking. We'll leverage libraries such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, and others.
Steps to Approach:

    Object Detection (using TensorFlow):
        Use a pre-trained object detection model (such as TensorFlow Object Detection API) to detect pickleball players, balls, and paddles in the video frames.
        Fine-tune or retrain the model on labeled pickleball data for higher accuracy.

    Object Tracking (using OpenCV):
        Once objects are detected in the initial frame, use tracking algorithms (like DeepSORT, CSRT, or KCF) to track them throughout the video frames.

    Pose Estimation (optional):
        If you want to track player movements (e.g., their arm position), you could integrate a pose estimation model like OpenPose or MediaPipe to detect the pose of players in addition to detecting the paddles.

    Real-time Processing:
        Implement the system to process video input (or camera feed) in real-time. Use OpenCV to capture the video feed, and process each frame through the detection and tracking models.

    Model Training:
        If necessary, you may need to collect or label pickleball-specific data (e.g., images of balls, players, and paddles) to fine-tune your models.

Here’s a basic framework of how this could be set up in Python:
Python Code for Pickleball Object Tracking

First, let's install the necessary dependencies:

pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless tensorflow numpy matplotlib

Then you can use the following code for implementing the system:

import cv2
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import time

# Load the pre-trained model (Object Detection)
model = tf.saved_model.load("ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco/saved_model")

# Define classes for pickleball (or use generic classes from COCO for testing)
# You may need to adjust class indices based on your custom dataset
PICKLEBALL_CLASSES = {1: 'person', 2: 'paddle', 3: 'ball'}

# Helper function for object detection
def run_inference_for_single_image(model, image):
    # Convert image to tensor
    image_np = np.asarray(image)
    input_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(image_np)
    input_tensor = input_tensor[tf.newaxis,...]

    # Run detection
    model_fn = model.signatures['serving_default']
    output_dict = model_fn(input_tensor)

    # Process outputs
    return {key:value.numpy() for key,value in output_dict.items()}

# Object tracking function (using OpenCV)
def track_objects(frame, boxes, class_ids, confidences, tracker):
    for i in range(len(boxes)):
        if confidences[i] > 0.5:  # Confidence threshold
            x, y, w, h = boxes[i]
            tracker.init(frame, (x, y, w, h))
    
    # Update the tracker
    success, boxes = tracker.update(frame)
    return success, boxes

# Main function
def main():
    # Open video capture (could be a webcam or video file)
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture("pickleball_video.mp4")  # Or 0 for webcam feed
    tracker = cv2.TrackerCSRT_create()  # Use OpenCV tracker (you can switch to others like KCF, MIL, etc.)

    while cap.isOpened():
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break
        
        # Preprocess the frame for object detection
        image = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
        
        # Run inference to detect objects (players, paddles, balls)
        output_dict = run_inference_for_single_image(model, image)
        
        # Extract detection data (boxes, class ids, confidences)
        boxes = output_dict['detection_boxes']
        class_ids = output_dict['detection_classes']
        confidences = output_dict['detection_scores']
        
        # Use the OpenCV tracker to track detected objects
        success, tracked_boxes = track_objects(frame, boxes, class_ids, confidences, tracker)
        
        # Draw the boxes around the tracked objects
        for i, box in enumerate(tracked_boxes):
            if success:
                (x, y, w, h) = [int(v) for v in box]
                cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (0, 255, 0), 2)
                class_name = PICKLEBALL_CLASSES.get(class_ids[i], 'Unknown')
                cv2.putText(frame, class_name, (x, y - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (255, 0, 0), 2)

        # Show the result in a window
        cv2.imshow("Pickleball Tracker", frame)

        # Stop if 'q' is pressed
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Explanation:

    Model Loading:
        The code uses a pre-trained SSD MobileNet model that is trained on the COCO dataset. You can modify this by either fine-tuning the model on your own labeled pickleball dataset or by using custom models trained specifically for pickleball tracking.

    Run Inference:
        The run_inference_for_single_image() function takes an image and runs object detection to detect various objects like players, balls, and paddles.

    Object Tracking:
        OpenCV’s TrackerCSRT (or other tracking algorithms) is used to track the detected objects frame-by-frame. This allows the system to follow the detected objects in real-time.

    Visualization:
        The code uses OpenCV to draw bounding boxes around the tracked objects and display them in real-time.

Next Steps:

    Model Customization:
        Collect a labeled dataset specific to pickleball (e.g., images of balls, paddles, players). Train or fine-tune an object detection model like SSD, YOLO, or Faster R-CNN for better accuracy in detecting pickleball-related objects.

    Optimizations:
        For better real-time performance, optimize the frame processing rate. You may want to use TensorFlow Lite or other optimization techniques for edge devices (if using mobile or embedded platforms).

    Pose Estimation:
        You could integrate pose estimation models (e.g., OpenPose, MediaPipe) to track player body movements, which would be useful for analyzing player positions and actions.

    Real-Time Feedback:
        After detecting and tracking the objects, you can calculate additional insights such as player movement, ball trajectory, etc., and display them as feedback or store them for further analysis.

Conclusion:

This code provides a basic framework for building an object detection and tracking system for pickleball players, paddles, and balls. You can extend it by adding more sophisticated tracking algorithms, pose estimation, and improving the object detection models. The system can be used in real-time video feeds to track and analyze pickleball training sessions for better performance insights.
